	<h2>Biography</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Carl I am a programmer and web developer currently based in Wellington, New Zealand.  <br>
	I was born in New Zealand and have lived in Wellington and the United States.  
	<br>My main area of expertises is as a developer whether it be desktop, mobile or web applications, I also have knowledge of all other aspects of development process from requirements gathering, analysis, design, building and most importantly testing, see projects for details.
	</p>
	<h3>Accessibility</h3>
	<p>I was born with a congenital eye condition called Aniridia, which can manifest itself in different ways and cannot lead to other conditions and problems.  However the one thing common is that yo do not have any irises.  I would like to note that my vision is considerable better than the norm for this condition.
	<br>This is one of the reasons I am in the technology and IT field, since I have used technology and IT tools to assist me throughout education.
	<br>I have a great interest in accessibility and how technology can be used to make people with any disability but particular blind and vision impaired people’s life’s better.  
	<br>I will discuss this issue more from time to time in my blog linked to on the left side bar
	</p><h3>Scouting</h3>
	<p>
	I first joined the Scout Movement in California as a Cub Scout in 1997, I later joined a local Scout group when I returned home to New Zealand.  I am currently a Rover, which is the adult service section of Scouting.
