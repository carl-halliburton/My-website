	<h3 id="woi">Woman of Influence with Opinions - Ascend Android App</h3>
	<ul class="lists">

	</ul>
	<p>This project was the brainchild of Keith Hawke owner of Hawke Films based in Nelson, New Zealand.  His daughters were approach the time to move into tertiary study or employment and had expressed a desire to hear from women who had been their and could give advice or anecdotes of being a women in the workforce, hence the Women of Influence project was born.
	<br>
	Later he approached WelTec to submit his project as part of the degree project paper.
	<br><br>
	I had the distinct privilege of forming a team with Pelise Tagata and Nick Rowley to undertake this project.  
	<br><br>
	The purpose of this paper is to work through a commercial level project and demonstrate skills learned during our degree.
	<br><br>
	One of the interesting features of my team of three was that none of us knew each other or had previously worked together, but we still managed to gain an A+ grade.   We were able to achieve a lot when working together as we could bounce ideas of each other and see how our different perspectives fitted in. 
	<br><br>
	One of the challenges we faced was integrating a range APIs into our app specifically for Dropbox, Facebook, Google Firebase and Google+.  To solve this we did a lot of research around this and many other aspect of the Android environment.  
	Throughout the project all three of us were directly involved in all aspects of development, from analysis, design development testing dealing with the client and doing the administration, therefore I have a good understanding of how a project works at all levels.

		<li> <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/carl-halliburton/Magnifier-for-Android'>Github Repository</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>I started this project for two reasons, one I wanted to create a magnifier for myself that fitted my needs or the needs of other people in the blind community.  And two I simply wanted to gain more experience and knowledge using 
	   the camera in applications as it is becoming a ubiquitous tool in a whide range of applications we use on a daily basis.</p>
	<h4>Tools Used</h4>

	</ul>
	<p>
	This project started in my final year at Heretaunga College, where I came into contact with web development and Adobe Dreamweaver in particular.  
I was asked by my father to create a website for his consulting company, which I did as class project.
I later recreated the site from scratch with HTML and CSS after gaining more knowledge in these languages.
